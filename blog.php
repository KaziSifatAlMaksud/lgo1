                 An energy audit is a process of evaluating the energy usage of a building, Plant or facility and identifying areas where energy efficiency improvements can be made. The objective of an energy audit is to identify areas of energy waste and recommend energy-efficient solutions to reduce energy consumption and costs.
An energy audit can be a valuable tool the organizations who looking to reduce their energy costs, improve their sustainability, and reduce their carbon footprint. In some cases, energy audits may also be required by local or state regulations, particularly for large commercial and industrial facilities.
Energy audit service is conducted by Lgorithm Services Limited by Certified and experienced professional energy auditor who are trained to conduct a comprehensive energy assessment of a facility or building.
In the time of an energy audit, the auditor of Lgorithm Services Limited collect data on the energy usage patterns of the building and analyze the data to identify areas where energy is being wasted. This may include evaluating the efficiency of heating and cooling systems, lighting systems, and other energy-consuming equipment.
During The energy audit process we typically do the below:
1.	Gathering data: This includes analyzing energy bills, examining building plans, and conducting interviews with facility managers and occupants to gain an understanding of the building's energy use and patterns.
2.	On-site inspection: Our auditor conducted a thorough inspection of the building, including its heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, and other energy-consuming systems.
3.	Analysis: Lgorithm auditor analyze the data collected during the inspection and identify areas where energy is being wasted.
4.	Recommendations: Based on the analysis, the auditor will recommend energy-efficient solutions to reduce energy consumption and costs. This may include upgrades to lighting, HVAC systems, insulation, and other energy-consuming systems.
5.	Reporting: The auditor will provide a detailed report that outlines the findings, recommendations, and potential savings from implementing the recommended energy-efficient solutions.

                 What is Power Quality Analysis?
The main purpose of the power system distribution is to ensure the proper operation of the loads. When an electrical power system fails to meet its purpose, it is time to analyze the problem, find the root cause.
Power quality analysis helps in the detection of problems in the power network. It will also help to address issues about the reliable and stable operation before they have an impact on the performance of your electrical system. Trained electrical professionals are required to analyze the power quality of a system.
Lgorithm Services Limited  offers an extensive power analysis solution that will enable you to diagnose and perform remedial actions for existing power problems or prevent them from occurring in the future. For power quality analysis, our Engineers use world-class equipment to measure multiple parameters in real-time. We will find areas of concern and provide you with a detailed report outlining potential solutions.

Is it necessary to analyze the quality of the power?
Power quality analysis is an important component of ensuring that your facility operates safely and efficiently. Many facility operators schedule power quality analyses as part of a normal plant testing routine, but others only request power quality analyses when a problem with the power source is found. However, to maintain safety and productivity, it’s important to have the quality of your facility’s power supply evaluated periodically even in the absence of detectable power issues. With proper power quality analysis, companies can save themselves millions of money each year in electrical repairs and service interruptions, as well as electrical utility costs.

Lgorithm Services Limited  Power Quality Analysis Capabilities
IEEE Power Quality Standards and NFPA 70B are outstanding assets to assist identify power quality terms, errors, and remedial actions. Our certified Engineers conduct power quality services according to these standards. our experienced Engineers know how and where to measure in order to gain precise insight into a plant’s power distribution. 
Once the analysis is performed, the Engineers study the data taken from the analysis to determine whether your facility’s power system is working as it should or if parts of the system need repair. After that, they give a report regarding all taken data as well as recommended actions by following international standards.
Data logging Function: By using our power quality analyzer we can log data for up to 365 days as well as we can calculate energy loss due to this loss.
