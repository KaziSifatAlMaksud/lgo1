                 An energy audit is a process of evaluating the energy usage of a building, Plant or facility and identifying areas where energy efficiency improvements can be made. The objective of an energy audit is to identify areas of energy waste and recommend energy-efficient solutions to reduce energy consumption and costs.
An energy audit can be a valuable tool the organizations who looking to reduce their energy costs, improve their sustainability, and reduce their carbon footprint.

                 <b>What is Power Quality Analysis?</b>
The main purpose of the power system distribution is to ensure the proper operation of the loads. When an electrical power system fails to meet its purpose, it is time to analyze the problem, find the root cause.
Power quality analysis helps in the detection of problems in the power network. It will also help to address issues about the reliable and stable operation before they have an impact on the performance of your electrical system. Trained electrical professionals are required to analyze the power quality of a system.
Lgorithm Services Limited  offers an extensive power analysis solution that will enable you to diagnose and perform remedial actions for existing power problems or prevent them from occurring in the future. For power quality analysis, our Engineers use world-class equipment to measure multiple parameters in real-time. We will find areas of concern and provide you with a detailed report outlining potential solutions.
<b>Is it necessary to analyze the quality of the power?</b><br>

Power quality analysis is an important component of ensuring that your facility operates safely and efficiently. Many facility operators schedule power quality analyses as part of a normal plant testing routine, but others only request power quality analyses when a problem with the power source is found. However, to maintain safety and productivity, it’s important to have the quality of your facility’s power supply evaluated periodically even in the absence of detectable power issues. With proper power quality analysis, companies can save themselves millions of money each year in electrical repairs and service interruptions, as well as electrical utility costs.
